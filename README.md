Referrer Control
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/muzuiget/referrer_control.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/muzuiget/referrer_control)

**Note:** Because Firefox 57 will [drop support legacy add-ons](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/16/the-road-to-firefox-57-compatibility-milestones/), and I don't had any time to migrate it to WebExtensions yet, this project is in maintain mode, bugfix only, no new feature.
